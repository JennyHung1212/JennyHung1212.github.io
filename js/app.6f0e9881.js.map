I was a two-year-old girl when I first visited there, and I didn't remember a thing at all. Just some cute pictures left that proofed I was once really there.\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tTaking a plane from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur only takes an hour. I wnet back to dorm to pack and rushed to the airport, and then suddenly, I was there! I walked out of the arrival hall, seeing my friend, Lisa, happily waving at me. Lisa and her families bring me to a night market near their home, and ate delicious Nasi Lemak. The queue for Nasi Lemak was very long. It took us about 40 minitues to get our food. The sauce on the chicken was extremely good and the spicy sauce served with the meal was super hot.

Me, my two roommates and the other girl who was our classmates and now study in SMU had brunch together on Wednesday morning. We ate at Bread Street in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, which is a resturant opened by Gordon Ramsay. If you have watched the Hell's Kitchen before, then you will definitely know this famous chef. He is famous for his superb cooking skills and his sharp personality. The food was extraordinary but really expensive. So I think this would be my first and the last time to dine in this high-grade resturant.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img mixed-triple\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame1 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/signboard.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame2 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/appetizer.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t  \t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame3 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/main.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__annotation\">1) Gordon Ramsay. 2) Appetizers 3) Main Dishes.

I have to say that the ticket is way expensive compared to Taipei Zoo. However, the zoo didn't let us down at all. The park is well organized and the diversity of the animals is high.

There was a elephant presentation at 3:30 pm. We got there just on time so we didn't had seats to sit. The elephants grabbed fruits with their long noses and rolled in the water. So cute!! If you want to go there sometimes, remember to get to the spot a little earlier then the starting time, so that you can have a close observation of the cute elephants. The other spot I really loved is Fragile Forest. There are many kinds of birds, flying fox, butterflies and others animals in that area. The animals there were not locked up in a restricted area respectively. They were actually wandering and flying around us! We are so used to the lifeless concrete jungle we live in, so it was REALLY fun and exciting to be surrounded by lots of lively animals.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img mixed-triple\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame1 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/blue_bird.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame2 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/lizard.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t  \t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame3 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week04-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/largest_flower.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__annotation\">1) Common Crowned Pigeon. 2) Inguana (forgot which type) 3) The worlds's largest flower!.</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/lizard.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week04/largest_flower.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tAfter the zoo, we went to 1-Altitude, the highest alfresco bar in the world and one of Singapore’s best rooftop bars with a spectacular 360-degree view of the city.

I woke up early and joined the second CIP event of TFI LEaRN Programme. It was the Makan Felloship held by YMCA Singapre. Around 60 elders joined the event. We helped to decorate the room, chat with the elders and play fun games with them. The two old ladies sit besides me speak 福建話, which is a dialect in Singapre, and is quite similar to Taiwanese.

The tickets are expensive but totally worth it. River Safari is a river-themed park. There are Mississipi River ( 密西西比河 ), Congo River ( 剛果河 ), Nile River ( 尼羅河 ), Ganges River ( 恆河 ), Mary River ( 瑪麗河 ), Mekong River ( 湄公河 ), Yangtze River ( 長江 ), and Amazon River ( 雅馬遜河 ). Each river section has their own species with some I've never seen before. You can closely observe the river creatures. The park is not so big, you can walk around it within an hour. However, we spent the whole afternoon in it because it's so much fun.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week07-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/river1.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week07-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/river2.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">Forgot which section are these...</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/river1.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/river2.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tThe Night Safari was even more fun! We got to explore the life of nocturnal animals. We first walked around the park on feet. Sometimes it was really hard to spot on the animals because it was really dark. After walking around, we hopped on the car that goes around the park. The car took us to a different area which was outside the walking zone. We saw some Malayan tapirs and deers walking on the street and heard some mighty roar of the male lions. After walking whole day, we were both very exhausted but we both agreed that the parks were worth the money and worth the time.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"schedule\">\n\t\t\t\t<span>03/09</span> YMCA Flag Day → Zam Zam → Masjid Sultan → Haji Lane → Abdul Gafoor Mosque → Little India Arcade → Chinatown → Maxwell Food Centre → Buddha Tooth Relic Temple → Sri Mariamman Temple → Masjid Jamae → Clarke Quay\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tThis morning was YMCA Flag Day, which was our last CIP event. Our mission was raising money from people on the streets. Some people took out their coins without any word; some people avoided us and walked fast past us; some gave us warm smiles; some didn't even take a look while we talked. This event changed my attitude toward this kind of fund-raising event. I used to be the one igonring them. But little by little, less could be more if every one of us is willing to be a part of it. After four hours standing on the street, my tin was half full. I'm grateful to those who were willing to stop by and took out their wallets. Their coins together are what make this world a little bit better.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image horizontal-single\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-single__frame img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week07-2\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/YMCA.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-single__annotation\">Alaska and her cute daughter came to Mac Pherson Station and bought us sugar cane juice!

The food their were really good. We had Beef Murtabak and Mutton Mee Goreng. Murtabak was like Roti Prata, but had eggs, onion and minced beef inside. The color of Mee Goreng was red! The sauce was really good, and I never tasted that taste before. After the lunch, we visited Masjid Sultan and Haji Lane. The houses along Haji lane were colorful and with graffitis on the wall. I bought a dress in one of the stores because it was super hot and I couldn't spend any other minute in my pants.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week07-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/zamzam.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week07-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/masjid.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) Beef Murtabak and Mutton Mee Goreng. 2) Masjid Sultan with golden roof.</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/zamzam.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week07/masjid.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tAlthough it was super hot, we still decided to walk to Little India on foot. On our way to Little India Arcade, we walked pass Abdul Gafoor Mosque.

I would definitely visit it again someday. After dinner, we stopped at Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple and Masjid Jamae to take some pictures. They are all on the same street within 10 minutes walking distance. We bought 東興蛋塔 on our way to Clarke Quay. The egg tart was very soft, delicious and tasted differently from all the egg tarts I've tasted before.

The exhibit reminds us the mistakes we made and to memorizes the inicent people that died during the wars.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img mixed-triple\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame1 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-4\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/church.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame2 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-4\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/war_museum.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t  \t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__frame3 img_lightbox\">\n\t  \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-4\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/city_museum.jpg\"/></a>\n\t  \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mixed-triple__annotation\">1) The pink Tan Dinh Church. 2) War Remnants Museu. 3) Hồ Chí Minh City Museum.</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/war_museum.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/city_museum.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tThe next day, I also woke up early. I had to seize every minute I got to explore the city. First, I went to Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts. There were three buildings with different style and color, and each one has an exhibit in it. The main building was built by a French architecture in 1929. The exhibits were a little bit under my expectation because some of the rooms were under constructions and aome others looked like nobody was taking care of them. However, I did have a good time there and took many pictures with the beautiful buildings. \n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-5\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art_museum.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-5\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art_museum2.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-5\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-5\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art2.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) The main building of the art museum. 2) The second building of the art museum. 3) One of the artworks I like. 4) One of the display room. </div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art_museum.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art_museum2.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/art2.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div> \n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tNext, I went to Ben Thanh Market that was known for the diversity of merchants and the cheap local cuisine. I ate Vietnamese spring rolls and watched how the lady made them with adept skills. I also found some purses of well-known brand that were super cheap that I couldn't help to doubt whether it's a fake one. There you can found souvenirs with very cheap price and have a glance of local people's daily lives. \n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tAfter a nice breakfast in the market, I headed over to a famous French bread shop called Huynh Hoa. I had my nails done in a cute shop on my way to the store that is said to have the most delicious French bread in HCMC. The cost of having both my hands and feet nails done were very very cheap, and their service was really good. The French bread didn't let me down. The hams in the bread suited well with the sauces and veggies. My tears even bursted out when I ate. You know why? Because the green chilis in the bead were extremely spicy. I never had chilis that is spicy as that before. After having French bread, I went to a restaurant that is famous for it's beef pho. The taste was slightly different from the one I had the day before, but still, it was so delious that I thought it would be the thing I miss the most after the journey.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/market.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/springroll.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/huynh_hoa.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week10-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/french_bread.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) Ben Thanh Market. 2) Vietnamese spring roll.

The attractions I visited is very different from the last time. I went to the attractions that is outside the city and some restaurants only local people know last time, this time we stay in downtown area most of the time, and went to some really nice bars.\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tFirst, I wanted to talk about the bars we went. After eating 鴻記瓦煲雞飯 at Jalan Petaling, we went to The Attic Bar. Just as it's name suggests, The Attic Bar is located at the attic of a hostel. When we first entered the door of the hostel, we were so confused, because it didn't look like a bar at all! Luckily a nice lady there told us that we should go all the way up with the spiral stairs. The bar was decorated with dark red light and birdcages, with light music playing in the background. They also have an outside area on the rooftop where you can enjoy the nightview and fresh air while drinking.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week11-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week11/pentaling.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week11-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week11/rice.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) The Jalan Petaling ( 茨廠街 ), which is a famous Chinese town in KL. 2) 鴻記瓦煲雞飯。</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week11/pentaling.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week11/rice.jpg\"/></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--text\">\n\t\t\t\tOn saturday night, we went to a bar called The Rabbit Hole, which is one of the bar on Changkat Bukit Bintang ( 酒吧街 ). The Rabbit Hole is an outdoor bar and has billiard pool and big TV screens in it. We also ordered chicken satay to eat with the cocktails. I really like the atmosphere of the vibe, not clamorous and not crowded. After the bar, we went to The Roof Cafe, where the best hookah in the city is served. All three of us have never tried hookah or shisha before, so this should be a very interesting and memorable experience. The flavor we ordered is the mix of grape, cantaloup and mint. We were chocked by the smoke at the beginning, but after some \"practices\", we were doing better and better.

The bar is hidden behind a toy shop. If you don't look carefully, you will never know there's a bar behind it! The bar is so famous that almost every table was reserved when we arrived. Luckily, there was still a spare table for us! The cocktails were all categorized by years which was very creative. Mine was from the category \"The Disco Era ( Dark Ages | 1970-2000s )\". The name of the cocktail was Salty Nihonsan, which is inspired by Japan’s recent summer heatwaves and the desire for liquid escapism. This bar is also decorated by red light and birdcages like The Attic Bar. I wondered if Malaysians love birdcages?\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tSecond, I want to talk about the attractions we visited this time. We went to Genting Highland and Batu Caves on the second day. The cable cars the bring people up to the highland were so amazing! It took about 15 minutes from bottom to the top. We can see various of trees and the mountain ridge under our feet, and the cloud flowing around us. As for Batu Caves, I finally knew how naughty the mokeys were this time! One of the monkey grabbed the plastic bag from my friend's hand and took away our cookies. I hopped that they enjoyed the cookies.\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tLast time when I visited Petronas Twin Towers, the weather wasn't good so I didn't take pictures with it. However, it rained even more heavily this time! But we still stood out in the rain and tried to take pictures with the breath-taking buildings.

The creamy salted egg sauce suited surprisingly perfect with the fried sliced pork. If the place was not that far away from SUTD, I would definitely visited it very often. The other delicacy I had was the Founder Bak Kut Teh. I just came back to Singapore from a long exhausted roud trip from Malacca, a hearty huge meal was what I need.

The food and places I haven't eaten or visited in Singapore</p>\n\t\t\t\tTime flies! The life in Singapore is now less than a month, so I decided to visit the places and restaurant in Singapore I've never visited before. First, I went to Changi Beach Park, which is not so far away from SUTD. The day I went was a very very hot day. I got a pretty funny and awkward dark triangle shape on my chest becuase of the suntan. I walked along the Changi Boardwalk, a trail that extend along the coastline. After the beach walk under the blazing sun, I went to Downtown Eash to sing karaoke with Kwangho and Joyce. The price is 18 SGD for 3 hours, a very fair price I have to say. The room was small but good enough for three of us. We had a really great time take turn singing Chinese, Cantonese and Korean songs. \n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tAs for the food, a friend who came to Singapore to exchange last year recommended me a restaurant that is famous for its salted egg pork rice. I took the bus for an hour just to have a taste of that delicious cuisine my frined vouched for. It turned out that the long-haul bus tour totally worths it! The creamy salted egg sauce suited surprisingly perfect with the fried sliced pork. If the place was not that far away from SUTD, I would definitely visited it very often. The other delicacy I had was the Founder Bak Kut Teh. I just came back to Singapore from a long exhausted roud trip from Malacca, a hearty huge meal was what I need. Everything that came into my mounth could be heavily delicious. You can see from the picture how much I ate, the waitress even reminded me that I might not be able to finish them if I ordered too much.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content__content--image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week12-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week12/beach.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week12-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week12/bagel.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week12-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week12/porkrice.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" data-lightbox=\"week12-1\"><img src=\"../../assets/images/week12/founder.jpg\"/></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) The whole Changi Boardwalk consists of Sunset Walk, Kelong Walk, Cliff Walk, Sailing Point Walk, Beach Walk and Creek Walk.

I spent lots of time on projects and the results turn out to be very satisfying. For ESA, me and my teammates design a card game about Singapore using the design techniques and softwares given in class.
