I wasn't there when the student account is available, but still, the ticket is cheap as hell! I might be a little bit exaggerated, but as a filmaholic like me, this is definitely a wonderful news. Next time I will know what to do when I feel boring. 🎬🎬🎬\n        <br />\n        <br />Now let's talk about this week starting with the Rice Balls Cooking Event! This Tuesday was Lantern Festival, which is a Chinese festival celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar. So I decided to invite some friends to cook rice balls in the hostel kitchen together. We bought three flavors: peanut, sesame and red bean. We cooked the rice balls in the boiled water and add brown sugar syrup with ginger flavor. The rice balls were really good! Although it was a little bit weird to celebrate Lantern Festival in such a hot weather, the tasty sweet rice balls did successful add on some holiday spirit.\n        <br />\n        <br />Next two days were my local-food-tasting days. I had Yong Tau Foo (釀豆腐) at Tampines on Wednesday. Yong tau foo is a Hakka Chinese cuisine consisting primarily of tofu filled with ground meat mixture or fish paste. There were also lots of vegetables to choose from. It's definitely on of my top three local food.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image horizontal-single\">\n        <div class=\"horizontal-single__frame img_lightbox\">\n          <a href data-lightbox=\"week05-1\">\n            <img src=\"../../assets/images/week05/taufoo.jpg\" />\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <div\n          class=\"horizontal-single__annotation\"\n        >Variation of 釀豆腐 include vegetables and mushrooms stuffed with ground meat or surimi.

Always use both your hand to carry the bottle when pourting wine for others. Thank you Kwangho for such a nice Korean dinner!! We chatted and listened to music till 9pm.

I found cheap deals online and I thought, why not? So I applied for visa immediately and searched online for the must-go attractions. This is my first time to travel abroad alone (except Singapore), I have to admit that I'm a little bit nervous!\n        <br />\n        <br />My flight was dealyed for 30 minutes, so I rushed to Visa On Arrival Counter right away after landing. When I got there, the waiting queue was alredy long. I waited there for an hour and couldn't connected to wifi. I was a little bit nervous because I missed the time of airport shuttle I booked for. Fortunately, the shuttle service company booked another car for me withought extra charge. How nice were they!\n        <br />\n        <br />To be honest, my first impression for HCMC wasn't very good, because I waited too long at the visa counter! But when I arrived in downtown and fetl the vibes of the city, I started to love it! The hostel I stayed in was near Pham Ngu Street and Bui Vien Street, which is the area of plenty of bars and clubs. There were some vendor selling French bread along the street. I bought one from a passionate guy and it tasted super good! There were a poached egg, sliced meat and some veegies in the bread. The sauce and the spring onions made the bread even better.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image\">\n        <div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-1\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/vendor.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-1\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/bread.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\"\n          >The vendor selling delicious French bread on Bui Vien.</div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n          <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/vendor.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/bread.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div\n        class=\"content__content--text\"\n      >I woke up early the next day and started my adventure.

I ordered Special Pho, which has beef tendon, beef balls and beef slices in it. The noddle was served with a plate of bean sprouts, kumquat and two different sauces. I fell in love with the beef pho at the first bite. After the nice Vietnamese style brunch, I went to Red Church. Red Church was under constructon so I only took a picture with it. Nest to the Red Chuch was the Saigon Central Post Office, which was built in 19th century when Vietnam was still under French coloniality. The post office was full of tourists who wanted to send their memory back home, and so did I. I send out fourteen post cards in total to my friends and families.</div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image\">\n        <div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\"\n            style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\"\n          >\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-3\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/pho.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\"\n            style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\"\n          >\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-3\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/coffee.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-3\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/postoffice.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-3\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/indoor.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\"\n          >1) The beef pho I had at Quan Ngon 138. 2) I wrote all the postcards at Trung Nguyen Café Legend, which is a coffee shop with white sands indoor! 3) The outside of Saigon Central Post Office. 4) Inside of the post office.</div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n          <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/pho.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/coffee.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/postoffice.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/indoor.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--text\">\n        Next, I went to Tan Dinh Church. The church was in pink color and stood out from its neiborhood. The light pink building looked so dreamy under the clear blue sky. I observed an interesting facts about HCMC while I walked on the streets. The cars and the motormikes were all mixed together on the roads and the traffic lights were small that I couldn't spot on it on my first sight. When corssing the road, you just have to take out your guts and slowing walk into the traffic, the drivers will all magically go pass you.\n        <br />\n        <br />After taking a bunch of selfies with the pink church, I went to the War Museum. The museum contains exhibits relating to the Vietnam War and the first Indochina War involving the French colonialists. There were many footages of soldiers and citizens during the war. You can see the numb in soldiers' eyes and the fear in citizens' eyes. I couldn't imagine going through the horrible life full of killing and parting. The exhibit reminds us the mistakes we made and to memorizes the inicent people that died during the wars.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image\">\n        <div class=\"desktop-img mixed-triple\">\n          <div class=\"inline-block\">\n            <div class=\"mixed-triple__frame1 img_lightbox\">\n              <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-4\">\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/church.jpg\" />\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"inline-block\">\n            <div class=\"mixed-triple__frame2 img_lightbox\">\n              <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-4\">\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/war_museum.jpg\" />\n              </a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mixed-triple__frame3 img_lightbox\">\n              <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-4\">\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/city_museum.jpg\" />\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"mixed-triple__annotation\"\n          >1) The pink Tan Dinh Church. 2) War Remnants Museu. 3) Hồ Chí Minh City Museum.</div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n          <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/war_museum.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/city_museum.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div\n        class=\"content__content--text\"\n      >The next day, I also woke up early. I had to seize every minute I got to explore the city. First, I went to Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts. There were three buildings with different style and color, and each one has an exhibit in it. The main building was built by a French architecture in 1929. The exhibits were a little bit under my expectation because some of the rooms were under constructions and aome others looked like nobody was taking care of them.

I ate Vietnamese spring rolls and watched how the lady made them with adept skills. I also found some purses of well-known brand that were super cheap that I couldn't help to doubt whether it's a fake one. There you can found souvenirs with very cheap price and have a glance of local people's daily lives.\n        <br />\n        <br />After a nice breakfast in the market, I headed over to a famous French bread shop called Huynh Hoa. I had my nails done in a cute shop on my way to the store that is said to have the most delicious French bread in HCMC. The cost of having both my hands and feet nails done were very very cheap, and their service was really good. The French bread didn't let me down. The hams in the bread suited well with the sauces and veggies. My tears even bursted out when I ate. You know why? Because the green chilis in the bead were extremely spicy. I never had chilis that is spicy as that before. After having French bread, I went to a restaurant that is famous for it's beef pho. The taste was slightly different from the one I had the day before, but still, it was so delious that I thought it would be the thing I miss the most after the journey.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image\">\n        <div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\"\n            style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\"\n          >\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-6\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/market.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\"\n            style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\"\n          >\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-6\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/springroll.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-6\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/huynh_hoa.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week10-6\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week10/french_bread.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div\n            class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\"\n          >1) Ben Thanh Market. 2) Vietnamese spring roll.

My thrilling experience of taking a bus ( coach ) from Malacca to Singapore</p>This part of the story is definitely the most memorable part of the whole journey. When I took a bus from Singapore, the driver was really nice and gave passengers clear instructions. Although it took longer then I expected, it was still a very pleasant trip. But went I took the bus from another compny from Malacca back to Singapore, it didn't went well, in fact, it was a very unpleasant experience.\n        <br />\n        <br />Let's just quickly skip the part that I failed to talk to the customer service via e-mail and phones. I tried to ask the customer how to retrieve my ticket, but I couldn't reach them at all. When I saw all the bad comments on Google, I thought, how bad can a bus trip be? Well, it went wrong in almost every away.\n        <br />\n        <br />My departure time is 7:30 am in the morning, so I arrived at the check-in counter at 7:00. When I arrived at the counter, the staff was sleeping in peace and sound. Me and other passnegers try to wake hip up by tapping on the glass door, he just didn't seem to be bothered at all, which really pissed me off! Fortunately, he woke up two minutes before the departure time, and started to handle things in a speed that could not ease my anger at all. The bus was late just as many angry passengers' comments online. The bus stopped at another station to pick up more passengers and stopped at a gas station, so it was even more delayed.\n        <br />\n        <br />We arrived at a bus terminal called Larkin Sentral at Johor Bahru at noon. The driver shout out \"luggage\" and asked everyone to get off the bus without any further instruction. I didn't think much and follow the passengers in front of me into the terminal, at that time, I was still not sure whether it's a terminal or a checkpoint. Later I found out that, if my destination was Singapore, I should follow the driver to another bus, not into the terminal. I was so shocked and nervous. I rushed out to the terminal immediately but the original bus was already gone, and I had no idea which bus to transfer to.\n        <br />\n        <br />Luckily, with some help from the nice security and the ladies in the counter, I successfuly find my way back after half an hour. I had to buy a new tickets to go to the checkpoint and transfer several buses to the terminal in Singapore. Now I learn my lesson, I can't act too fast if I feel unsure and definitely have to search more information online before every trip.

Two of my favorite landmarks in Singapore</p>This week I went to places I've not yet visited, two of them were Botanic Garden and Singapore National Gallery. I really really regretted that I didn't go there earlier! \"Beautiful\" is far from enough to describe Botanic Garden. I was really surprised by how greenish and diverse the plants were. The garden is 82 hectares big and has lakes, meadows and several small garden with different themes in it. If you want to visit every corner in the garden, it would take you at least half a day. My favorite themed garden is Evolution Garden. The plants in this garden is ordered according to time, starting from the inception of life on earth, to the era of dinosaurs, and finally into the modern world. The most famous themed garden would probably be National Orchid Garden. The tickets for students are only one dollar! There are many kinds of orchids with different colors in it. The whole garden literally looks like a painting, a painting of blossoming flowers, countless of greenness and breezy wind. The other spot I really like is Standband, which is a octagonal gazebo built in 1930. The surrounding Yellow Rain Trees make the gazebo even more beautiful.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"content__content--image\">\n        <div class=\"desktop-img horizontal-double\">\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame1 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week13-1\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week13/forest.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__frame2 inline-block img_lightbox\">\n            <a href data-lightbox=\"week13-1\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week13/bandstand.jpg\" />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"horizontal-double__annotation\">1) The Evolution Garden. 2) The Bandstand.</div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mobile-img swiper-container\">\n          <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week13/forest.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/week13/bandstand.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-next\"></div>\n          <div class=\"swiper-button-prev\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div\n        class=\"content__content--text\"\n      >As if Singapore National Gallery, I fell in love with it soon after I walked into it.

I was impressed by the number of artworks it displayed and how well-organized the whole gallery was.
