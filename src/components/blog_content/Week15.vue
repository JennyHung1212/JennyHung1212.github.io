        I'm a person with a really bad habit, that is doing things in the last minutes, including planning a trip. I decided to have this trip a week before departure because I wanted make use of the last week of my exchange life.
        <br />
        <br />Overall, I like Penang much more than Malacca. Penang preserevs more of its "old look" and you don't get to smell lots of commercialization around here. It always fascinates me when it comes to historical and old things. I'm not a very nostalgic person, but I just can't resist the charm of the things with old stories.
        <br />
        <br />I rented a bike on the second day so that I could move around the George Town more easily without burining myself under the sun. Penang was a prosperous trade port, so there are many jetty points along the coast. I visited almost everyone of them. I also went to Wonder Food Museum where they exhibit the giant version of traditional Malay cuisines, and Time Tunnel Museum about where I took many 3D-effect photos.

      >The next day I went to The Habitat Penang Hill, which is a natural park in Penang Hill. There is a Curtis Crest where you can enjoy the mountain view on a 360° tree-top trail, and also a Langur Way for you to wander between the trees. Despite The Habitat, there are many other walking trails and also a food court where you can feed youself up after an exhausting hike.</div>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">2. Palau Ubin Island</p>Palau Ubin is an island sitted at the north of Singapore island, it is one of the few places in Singapore with no trace of modernization. It only takes 3 Singapore dollars for one-round ferry. Walking in the Palau Ubin Island is like walking in a primeval forest. The trees are tall that they almost cover the sky. Although there was a super heavy rain that day, me and Joyce still enjoy the natural vibe a lot. Now I'm kind of regret of not visiting there earlier!

I packed all my stuffs into two big suit cases, just like that, a room full of 4-month of memories are now empty. I missed my friends, my families, my home, but I was still a little bit reluctant to leave. Thank you SUTD, thank you TFI LEaRN Programme, and thank you Singapore for giving me my most adventurous time of my life!
