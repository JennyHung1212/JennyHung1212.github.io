				I had a friend from NTU chorous who is a Malaysian. She goes back to Malaysia every winter and summer vacation. So I decided to visit her in Kuala Lumpur. This is my second thim in Malaysia. I was a two-year-old girl when I first visited there, and I didn't remember a thing at all. Just some cute pictures left that proofed I was once really there.
				<br/><br/>
				Taking a plane from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur only takes an hour. I wnet back to dorm to pack and rushed to the airport, and then suddenly, I was there! I walked out of the arrival hall, seeing my friend, Lisa, happily waving at me. Lisa and her families bring me to a night market near their home, and ate delicious Nasi Lemak. The queue for Nasi Lemak was very long. It took us about 40 minitues to get our food. The sauce on the chicken was extremely good and the spicy sauce served with the meal was super hot. I bursted into tears the second I tasted it.

				Next day, I woke up with excimentment, looking forward to the attractions we were going to visit that day. I was really lucky because Lisa's aunt would drive us around the city.
				<br/><br/>
				The first stop is Istana Negara, the National Palace of Malaysia. The building is very majestic. The surface of the palace was covered with some golden paint. It shined under the couldless blue sky, made the palace even more noble.

				After lunch, we went to Central Market and Petaling Street. The stores in Central Market sell traditional handicrafts, clothing and artworks. We met an artist who made 捕夢網. He was very hospitable and tought us how to make one. He said that it took him years of practicing and thousands of pieces to make him a master. The 捕夢網 he made were very beautiful and exquisite. The last stop was the famous skyscraper KLCC. Unfortunately, the weather was bad in the evening so I couldn't take a good picture of KLCC. But we had delicious local desserts at Nyonya Colors at KLCC. A good dessert can always make the day.

				The next day is even more exciting! We had 辣椒板麵 as breakfast. The noodle tasted super good with the half-cooked egg and paprika in it. After breakfast, we headed to Batu Caves, a limestone hill that has a series of caves and cave temples. The stairs to the caves are colorful and there were many monkeys around the caves. The Buddha statue standing at the entrance of the cave is very tall and solemn.

				In the afternoon, we went to Putrajaya, where Perdana Putra, others government agencies and Putra Mosque located at. The green-domed Perdana Putra contains the prime minister’s office complex. In front of the Perdana Putra is a big plaza and next to the plaza is Putra Mosque, made from rose-colored granite with a pink dome. There were two hours left until the opening hours of the mosque, so we just walked around the plaza and took lots of great piectures.

				The last stop is the Moroccan Pavilion of the Putrajaya Botanical Garden. We didn't walk around the whole Botanical Garden, only stayed at the Moroccan-style garden. The pavilion in the garden is the color of dusty rose, so elegant and luscious. If there were more time, I really wanted to walk around the whole garden. The garden spans over an area of 93 hectares. There are a big lake,  palm hill and floral gardens. It must be nice to spend a relaxing afternoon in there.
