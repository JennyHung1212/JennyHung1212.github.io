				Before I start writing about the things happened this week, I have to tell you this first. <span style="font-weight: bold">The movie tickets in Singapore are SOOO CHEAP!!!</span> I went to Golden Village at Paya Lebar to see the movie "Serenity" on Thursday, and it only cost me SGD 8.5, which is 2 dollars cheaper than Taiwan (in SGD)!! I wasn't there when the student account is available, but still, the ticket is cheap as hell! I might be a little bit exaggerated, but as a filmaholic like me, this is definitely a wonderful news. Next time I will know what to do when I feel boring. 🎬🎬🎬

				Now let's talk about this week starting with the Rice Balls Cooking Event! This Tuesday was Lantern Festival, which is a Chinese festival celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar. So I decided to invite some friends to cook rice balls in the hostel kitchen together. We bought three flavors: peanut, sesame and red bean. We cooked the rice balls in the boiled water and add brown sugar syrup with ginger flavor. The rice balls were really good! Although it was a little bit weird to celebrate Lantern Festival in such a hot weather, the tasty sweet rice balls did successful add on some holiday spirit.

				Next two days were my local-food-tasting days. I had Yong Tau Foo (釀豆腐) at Tampines on Wednesday. Yong tau foo is a Hakka Chinese cuisine consisting primarily of tofu filled with ground meat mixture or fish paste. There were also lots of vegetables to choose from. It's definitely on of my top three local food.

				I went to Old Airport Road Food Court on Thursday, which is recommended by a local student. Old Airport Road FC has a great variety of food to choose from, and the price is really reasonable. I had mango-dragonfruit juice, hokkien fried mee (福建蝦麵) and Cheong Fun (腸粉). The interesting thing about hokkien fried mee is that it's wrapped in paper! I think I will visit there again soon, and maybe go see a movie after that as well.

				Finally, there comes the most exciting event of the week! The Night Cycling! We started from Singapore Sports Hub (National Stadium), via Gardens by the Bay, MBS, had a meal at East Coast Park, and rode back to National Stadium. We started at around 10 pm and finished at 3:30 am. The route is about 32 kilometers long, which is quite relaxing for a 4-hour ride. The city still looks very beatutiful at night and I made friends with some local students of SUTD and also some foreign students from others schools. After the event, I decided to ride a bike to Johor Bahru, which is a city of Malaysia that is connected to Singapore. And maybe cycling around the Singapore island. I'm so escited about it!
