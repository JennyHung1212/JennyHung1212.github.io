				This is my second time to Kuala Lumpur this term, but I'm still very excited. The attractions I visited is very different from the last time. I went to the attractions that is outside the city and some restaurants only local people know last time, this time we stay in downtown area most of the time, and went to some really nice bars.
				<br/><br/>
				First, I wanted to talk about the bars we went. After eating 鴻記瓦煲雞飯 at Jalan Petaling, we went to The Attic Bar. Just as it's name suggests, The Attic Bar is located at the attic of a hostel. When we first entered the door of the hostel, we were so confused, because it didn't look like a bar at all! Luckily a nice lady there told us that we should go all the way up with the spiral stairs. The bar was decorated with dark red light and birdcages, with light music playing in the background. They also have an outside area on the rooftop where you can enjoy the nightview and fresh air while drinking.

				On saturday night, we went to a bar called The Rabbit Hole, which is one of the bar on Changkat Bukit Bintang ( 酒吧街 ). The Rabbit Hole is an outdoor bar and has billiard pool and big TV screens in it. We also ordered chicken satay to eat with the cocktails. I really like the atmosphere of the vibe, not clamorous and not crowded. After the bar, we went to The Roof Cafe, where the best hookah in the city is served. All three of us have never tried hookah or shisha before, so this should be a very interesting and memorable experience. The flavor we ordered is the mix of grape, cantaloup and mint. We were chocked by the smoke at the beginning, but after some "practices", we were doing better and better. That was my first time to feel like I'm floating in the air!

				On Sunday night, we visited a very special bar. The bar is hidden behind a toy shop. If you don't look carefully, you will never know there's a bar behind it! The bar is so famous that almost every table was reserved when we arrived. Luckily, there was still a spare table for us! The cocktails were all categorized by years which was very creative. Mine was from the category "The Disco Era (Dark Ages|1970-2000s )". The name of the cocktail was Salty Nihonsan, which is inspired by Japan’s recent summer heatwaves and the desire for liquid escapism. This bar is also decorated by red light and birdcages like The Attic Bar. I wondered if Malaysians love birdcages?
				<br/><br/>
				Second, I want to talk about the attractions we visited this time. We went to Genting Highland and Batu Caves on the second day. The cable cars the bring people up to the highland were so amazing! It took about 15 minutes from bottom to the top. We can see various of trees and the mountain ridge under our feet, and the cloud flowing around us. As for Batu Caves, I finally knew how naughty the mokeys were this time! One of the monkey grabbed the plastic bag from my friend's hand and took away our cookies. I hopped that they enjoyed the cookies.
				<br/><br/>
				Last time when I visited Petronas Twin Towers, the weather wasn't good so I didn't take pictures with it. However, it rained even more heavily this time! But we still stood out in the rain and tried to take pictures with the breath-taking buildings. I finally had some good pictures with the towers this time!
