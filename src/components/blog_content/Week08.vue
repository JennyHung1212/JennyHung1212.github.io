        On monday morning, me and my boyfriend went to Tanah Merah to take the ferry. It took about 30 minutes from Tanah Merah to Batam Island. Batam Island is a island of Indonesia that is below Singapore. The size of it is slightly smaller than Singapore. I have to admit that I didn't make any plan for the two-days trip, I just want to relax and have some pleasant massage.
        <br />
        <br />The food on Batam Island was very cheap! Usually it only cost us around 2~3 SGD to have a meal. The local dish was Nasi Goreng, Nasi Lemak Ayam, Layer Cake, etc. So we could eat whatever we want and don't have to worry about the price.
        <br />
        <br />So here's what we did on Tuesday. Slept till 11 in the morning, went to Nagoya Hill Mall to have lunch, bought layer cake to eat, went to Nest to have a 2-hour whole body massage, and then walked around the mall and finally had dinner. A very lazy schedule.
