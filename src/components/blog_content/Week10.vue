				I bought the air tickets and booked the hotel one week before my departure. I found cheap deals online and I thought, why not? So I applied for visa immediately and searched online for the must-go attractions. This is my first time to travel abroad alone (except Singapore), I have to admit that I'm a little bit nervous!
				<br/><br/>
				My flight was dealyed for 30 minutes, so I rushed to Visa On Arrival Counter right away after landing. When I got there, the waiting queue was alredy long. I waited there for an hour and couldn't connected to wifi. I was a little bit nervous because I missed the time of airport shuttle I booked for. Fortunately, the shuttle service company booked another car for me withought extra charge. How nice were they!
				<br/><br/>
				To be honest, my first impression for HCMC wasn't very good, because I waited too long at the visa counter! But when I arrived in downtown and fetl the vibes of the city, I started to love it! The hostel I stayed in was near Pham Ngu Street and Bui Vien Street, which is the area of plenty of bars and clubs. There were some vendor selling French bread along the street. I bought one from a passionate guy and it tasted super good! There were a poached egg, sliced meat and some veegies in the bread. The sauce and the spring onions made the bread even better.

				I woke up early the next day and started my adventure. The weather was very good. The sweat kept dripping down as I walked on the street. The first stop was Independence Palace, which was the home and workplace of the President of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The offices, meeting rooms, bedrooms in the majestic building were preserved as they were before. The most impressive area was the bunker. The old communicating equipments used during the Vietnam war were displayed in the rooms. It was like going back to the old days when walking in the bunker with strong security.

				There was a local food resturat called Quan Ngon 138 across the Independence Palace. Although it was only ten in the morning and I had my breakfast before leaving hostel, I still decided to go in and have a taste of local cuisine. I ordered Special Pho, which has beef tendon, beef balls and beef slices in it. The noddle was served with a plate of bean sprouts, kumquat and two different sauces. I fell in love with the beef pho at the first bite. After the nice Vietnamese style brunch, I went to Red Church. Red Church was under constructon so I only took a picture with it. Nest to the Red Chuch was the Saigon Central Post Office, which was built in 19th century when Vietnam was still under French coloniality. The post office was full of tourists who wanted to send their memory back home, and so did I. I send out fourteen post cards in total to my friends and families.

				Next, I went to Tan Dinh Church. The church was in pink color and stood out from its neiborhood. The light pink building looked so dreamy under the clear blue sky. I observed an interesting facts about HCMC while I walked on the streets. The cars and the motormikes were all mixed together on the roads and the traffic lights were small that I couldn't spot on it on my first sight. When corssing the road, you just have to take out your guts and slowing walk into the traffic, the drivers will all magically go pass you.
				<br/><br/>
				After taking a bunch of selfies with the pink church, I went to the War Museum. The museum contains exhibits relating to the Vietnam War and the first Indochina War involving the French colonialists. There were many footages of soldiers and citizens during the war. You can see the numb in soldiers' eyes and the fear in citizens' eyes. I couldn't imagine going through the horrible life full of killing and parting. The exhibit reminds us the mistakes we made and to memorizes the inicent people that died during the wars.

				The next day, I also woke up early. I had to seize every minute I got to explore the city. First, I went to Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts. There were three buildings with different style and color, and each one has an exhibit in it. The main building was built by a French architecture in 1929. The exhibits were a little bit under my expectation because some of the rooms were under constructions and aome others looked like nobody was taking care of them. However, I did have a good time there and took many pictures with the beautiful buildings.

				Next, I went to Ben Thanh Market that was known for the diversity of merchants and the cheap local cuisine. I ate Vietnamese spring rolls and watched how the lady made them with adept skills. I also found some purses of well-known brand that were super cheap that I couldn't help to doubt whether it's a fake one. There you can found souvenirs with very cheap price and have a glance of local people's daily lives. 
				<br/><br/>
				After a nice breakfast in the market, I headed over to a famous French bread shop called Huynh Hoa. I had my nails done in a cute shop on my way to the store that is said to have the most delicious French bread in HCMC. The cost of having both my hands and feet nails done were very very cheap, and their service was really good. The French bread didn't let me down. The hams in the bread suited well with the sauces and veggies. My tears even bursted out when I ate. You know why? Because the green chilis in the bead were extremely spicy. I never had chilis that is spicy as that before. After having French bread, I went to a restaurant that is famous for it's beef pho. The taste was slightly different from the one I had the day before, but still, it was so delious that I thought it would be the thing I miss the most after the journey.

				In the afternon, I walked to Pho Di Bo Nguyen Hue, which is a walking area in front of Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee. One of the famoust spot there is the cafe apartment. Cafe apartment is a 9-storey buildings with nearly 30 caffee shops in it. I walked through every floors and picked one called Saigon Oi at 4th floor. I ordered a piece of matcha cake and Saigon Oi Special, both were tasty and really took my tiredness of walking all day. 
				<br/><br/>
				I was supposed to watch AO Show in the evening but I bought the ticket of a different theater. How stupid was I! But thinking on the bright side, this incident gave me a reason to go visit HCMC again!

				Happy time always seems shoter! The journey came to the end with just a blink. On the day I left, I had traditional breakfast with a Vietnamese girl I met in the mostel. She was very friendly. We talked about our views of relationships and cultures. We also taught each other our own language. I was very lucky that I could meet this lovely person in an unfamiliar country. The best part of the journey is always the people you met!

				Overall, this solo trip went really well except I accidentally bought the wrong ticket of AO show. People in Ho Chi Minh City seem to enjoy their lives a lot. The local foods are all very cheap and delicious. The history of French coloniality brought different colors to this Asian city and made it even more attractive. I'll definitely visit there again in the future8
