        <p style="font-weight: bold">1. Two of my favorite landmarks in Singapore</p>This week I went to places I've not yet visited, two of them were Botanic Garden and Singapore National Gallery. I really really regretted that I didn't go there earlier! "Beautiful" is far from enough to describe Botanic Garden. I was really surprised by how greenish and diverse the plants were. The garden is 82 hectares big and has lakes, meadows and several small garden with different themes in it. If you want to visit every corner in the garden, it would take you at least half a day. My favorite themed garden is Evolution Garden. The plants in this garden is ordered according to time, starting from the inception of life on earth, to the era of dinosaurs, and finally into the modern world. The most famous themed garden would probably be National Orchid Garden. The tickets for students are only one dollar! There are many kinds of orchids with different colors in it. The whole garden literally looks like a painting, a painting of blossoming flowers, countless of greenness and breezy wind. The other spot I really like is Standband, which is a octagonal gazebo built in 1930. The surrounding Yellow Rain Trees make the gazebo even more beautiful.

      >As if Singapore National Gallery, I fell in love with it soon after I walked into it. I was blown away by the majestic building. Actually, I should say "buildings", because the gallery is combined with two old builings, the former Supreme Court Building and City Hall. There is a link brindge between the court wing and the city hall wing. The gallery is so big that I couldn't visit every room. I was impressed by the number of artworks it displayed and how well-organized the whole gallery was. There are Victoria Theater, Arts House and Asian Civilisations Museum in the neighborhood of National Gallery, a very good place to walk around. And most importantly, the tickets for sutdents in Singapore are totally free!</div>

      >The other place I went this week was Peranakan Colorful Houses at Katong. There traditional peranakan houses around twenty houses on the street, all in similar style but with different colors. The nearby areas also have traditional peranakan houses, but they weren't as colorful as those. When I arrived at the spot, there were alredy some tourists taking pictures with the houses. I thought it was a secret location that only few tourists know, however, it turned out that it was in fact a popular check-in spot on Instagram.</div>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">2. All the delicious food I had this week</p>First, I have to mention the food me, Kwangho and Joyce prepared together. On the day we sang karaoke, we decided to have another dinner together and each one of us should prepare the dish of our own countries. I bought Hokkian noodle from a popular brand in Taiwan. Kwangho cooked spicy noodles and instant Tteokbokki. Joyce was the most diligent one, she made wontons herself! We had a really nice dinner and pleasant chat, I'm going to me these two a lot when I'm back in Taiwan. Next one is 黃亞細肉骨茶, one of the three most famouse bak kut teh stores in Singapore. The soup was the strongest among the three. I ordered 油條 with the soup. The 油條 suit surprisingly well with the soup!
        <br />
        <br />The third one is prata with onion, egg, mushrooms and cheese. I googled up "famouse breakfast in Singapore" weeks ago, and I found Poh Ho Restaurant, so I decided to give it a try. There were five different stalls in Poh Ho Restaurant, all selling different kinds of food. It's said that Poh Ho is famous among the locals, because it's cheap, delicious and is located in the residential area. The last one is Five Star Chicken Rice. Just as its name suggests, the chicken rice was quite good. It tasted especially with the spicy sauce.
        <br />
        <br />That's it for this week food journey, next week I go explore more!!
