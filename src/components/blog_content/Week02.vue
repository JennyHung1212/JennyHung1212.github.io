        I had been looking forward to this week since I got to Singapore, because my families would be visiting!! This Chinese New Year is my first faraway-from-home New Year, so my families decided to visit Singapore durining the Chinese New Year holiday.
        <br />
        <br />We went to Clarke Quay for dinner the day they arrived. We ate at 無招牌海鮮 and ordered their signature dish 麥片鮮蝦. The shrimps didn't let us down. They tasted just as good as we expected. However, the price did surprised us! We found out that they charged for wet wipes and even the peanuts served before the dish. To be honest, those were the most expensive peanuts I ever had. Back in Taiwan, everything other than your orders is free! Hot tea is free, water is free, wet wipes are free, toothpicks are free, and the smiles on the faces of waiters are also free. I really missed that.

The Supertree Grove is very pretty in the nights, the dreamy neon lights made me think of the movie Avatar. After the relaxing walk, we headed back to the hotel. Me and my sis went to the inifity pool of Marina Bay Sands to enjoy the beautiful night view. What a luxurious night for us!</div>

      >We spent next two days on Sentosa Island. It's really nice that the transportaion on the island is all free! Sentosa Express comes in every five minutes, it takes you to almost every attractoins on the island. There are also buses running around the island and the cable cars where you can enjoy the view of the island from above. We went to S.E.A. Aqurium, played Skyline Luge and spent a day in Universal Studio! The Universal Studio is so much fun. Although the queues at all the rides are quite long, the pleasure we got is definitely worth waiting! In the morning we left the island, we walked around the Palawan beach, which is the southermost point of continental Asia! However, there were some garbages left on the beach, so my dad and mom spent some time to gather them. Despite this, the beach was still very beautiful. The sands were soft and the water was cool. The cloudless sky was blue and connected with the boundless sea. That is definitely a view that I will keep in my mind.</div>
