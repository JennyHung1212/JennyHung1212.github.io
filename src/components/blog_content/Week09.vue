				I had a really miserable time on first two days of this week, I had a fever and diarrhea. Everything I ate just came out. The worst part is, it's midterm week! So I really had to get togehter and try to study. Hope I didn't screw up on the exams.
				<br/><br/>
				It's always good for health to walk out in the nature! On Saturday, Kwangho and I went to MacRitchie Reservoir Windsor Nature Park. The weather was very good, the sky was clear and the sun was warm. It took us almost an hour to go to MacRitchie Reservoir. We started from the MacRitchie Trail, walked 4.3 km to the entrance of TreeTop walk, and walked another 4 km ( forgot the precise distance ) to Venus Drive car park. We spent about 3 hours walking and there were many monkeys on the way. They are so cute! They ran around freely along the trails and jumped from on tree to another. Besides the monkeys, we also saw lizards, squirrel and giant ants. Those giant ants were big as hell. I never saw an ant huge like that!

				The TreeTop Walk is 250m long with the highest at 25m. It is a one-way walkway that lies above trees. You can literally walk ON the trees and see sundry tropical plants.

				After the walk, we went to Newton Foodcourt to have lunch. We decided to share a plate of rojak together. We both agreed that one time of trying is enough.  The term rojak also means "mixture" or "eclectic mix" in colloquial Malay. The one we ordered had toufu, youtiao, dried fish, cucumber, pineapple and pear in it. The sauce served with rojak was black and sweet. We also ordered some indian dishes like chicken curry and Masala Papadam.

				At the evening, Kwangho prepared an instant Korean dinner! We had chili noodle and korean rice. Most importantly, we drank soju and makgeolli ( rice wine ). That was my first time to have Korean wine. Soju is really really strong, even a small sip made my face twisted. Makgeolli tastes much more smoother than soju. Kwangho introunced the traditional way to drink makgeolli. Always use both your hand to carry the bottle when pourting wine for others. Thank you Kwangho for such a nice Korean dinner!! We chatted and listened to music till 9pm. What a wonderful day with nature and Korean culture.
